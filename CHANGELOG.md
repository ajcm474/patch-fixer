## Version 0.5.0
- Major refactoring for better code organization (functional approach)
  - Add `validators.py` module with pure validation functions
  - Add `transformers.py` module with pure transformation functions
  - Add `analyzer.py` module for read-only patch analysis
  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Add support for processing hooks in `fix_patch`:
  - `pre_hunk_hook` and `post_hunk_hook` for custom processing
  - `strict` mode for fail-fast behavior (not implemented)
- Add comprehensive patch analysis functionality:
  - `analyze_patch()` for detailed patch information
  - `find_potential_issues()` for detecting common problems
  - `get_patch_summary()` for human-readable summaries
- Add new transformation utilities:
  - `fix_file_paths()` for normalizing path prefixes
  - `normalize_line_endings()` for consistent line endings
  - `split_patch_by_file()` for dividing multi-file patches
- Add extensive test coverage for new modules
- Abandon OOP branch after determining functional approach is better suited
  for patch processing problems

## Version 0.4.1
- Achieve 4x speedup by removing whitespace-tolerant exact matching
  - None of the integration tests needed this
  - Fuzzy matching should cover cases with mismatched whitespace
  - Investigation still pending for `myriadrf/LimeSDR-Mini` bottleneck
    - This diff has 2 million+ lines, so some slowdown is expected but not infinite 
    - The test seems to exhibit nondeterministic behavior w.r.t. `IndexError`
    - File streaming might fix it, but that would break any middle-of-list insertion
- Rule out file creation/deletion as a source of testing bottleneck
- Handle paths containing spaces

## Version 0.4.0
- Fix all remaining integration test failures
  - Temporarily disable `myriadrf/LimeSDR-Mini` test due to unreasonable execution time
  - Majorly overhaul `find_hunk_start` and `capture_hunk` to
    - Properly raise errors instead of returning 0 on failure
    - Disregard `\ No newline at end of file` within hunk
    - Look for the *correct* match, not just the first one
    - Use condensed header format if the hunk only has 1 line
    - Keep track of full old header rather than just context
- Reorganize custom exceptions under a new `HunkErrorBase` class
  - Add new error type `OutOfOrderHunk`
  - Make `MissingHunkError` inherit from `HunkErrorBase`
  - Fix misleading error messages (no longer shows addition lines)
  - Enhance error reporting with `format_hunk_for_error()` function
- Improve hunk finding reliability with whitespace-tolerant exact matching
- Add unit tests for hunk finding
- Fix `--add-newline` behavior to correctly replace "No newline at end of file" marker with actual newline
- Fix final newline preservation logic to respect `add_newline` parameter
- Add encoding detection with fallback for non-UTF-8 files (handles Latin-1, CP1252, etc.)
- Add error handling for files with unsupported encodings
- Improve test coverage for CLI options and encoding edge cases
- TODO:
  - Find and fix bottleneck for `myriadrf/LimeSDR-Mini` test case
  - Figure out why the test suite still takes ~10 seconds to run
  - Deduplicate code

## Version 0.3.4
- Add comprehensive CLI tests
- Fix bug where fix_patch would try to chdir to a file instead of its parent directory
- Experimentally support fuzzy string matching at the line level
  - Some tests fail; implementation subject to change
- Address some outstanding TODOs while clarifying others

## Version 0.3.3
- Add unified command-line interface with `patch-fixer` command
- Support both `fix` and `split` subcommands
- Fix hypothesis test for line normalization
- Update README with comprehensive usage documentation
- Add console script entry point for easier CLI access

## Version 0.3.2
- Implement `split_patch` function for dividing patches by file lists
- Fix f-string syntax errors in `patch_fixer.py`  
- Add comprehensive tests for `split_patch` functionality

## Version 0.3.1
- Make line normalization robust to edge cases
- Add unit tests for line normalization
- Add `hypothesis` to test requirements
- Add more repos to integration tests, focusing on edge cases
  - Most of these fail (growing pains are expected with TDD)

## Version 0.3.0
- Adjust path regex to accommodate rename headers
- Fix remaining integration test failures
  - Stop handling `+` lines different from `-` lines in `normalize_line`
  - Fix bug in `find_hunk_start` where lines consisting only of dashes were ignored
  - Make sure *any line* that gets added to `fixed_lines` has a newline at the end
  - `new_start` in hunk header is now set to `0` on file deletion instead of `1`
- Support renames with less than 100% similarity
- Update test script to keep line endings from the autogenerated diff
- Codestyle changes
  - Normalize line and block comments to all start with a lowercase letter
  - Normalize functions + classes to all have 2 blank lines in between
- TODO:
  - Anything explicitly marked with a `# TODO` comment
  - Fix line lengths and add more blank lines for structure
  - Refactor match/case blocks to each be their own function
  - Set up GitHub Actions / automate releases on GitHub

## Version 0.2.3
- Update README to reflect new usage patterns now that this package is available on PyPI
- Fix bug in error message when a hunk is not found

## Version 0.2.2
- List package on PyPI

## Version 0.2.1
- Experimentally support file deletion in file headers
- Update index counting

## Version 0.2.0
- Move `GitPython` out of test requirements and into main requirements
- Fix a few outstanding bugs with how index lines were parsed
- Add support for regenerating missing index lines
  - Only support in the cases of file deletion, or rename, 
  as anything else would require parsing the patch changes to generate 
  the SHA, which is explicitly out of scope for now
  - Note that this is an experimental new feature that has not been tested

## Version 0.1.0
- Change project name from "code-diff-fixer" to "patch-fixer"
